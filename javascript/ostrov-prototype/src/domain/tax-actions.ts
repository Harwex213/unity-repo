/**
 * The tax phase. It opens with every die on every island rolled once. Each of
 * the player's buildings plays a short production pulse, top to bottom, and its
 * roll pops up above it (see `core/production-reveal.ts`). The reveal owns the
 * turn (`ui.busy`) until the last plate lands; the wheel can skip it. The
 * player reads the rolls on the hexes and may spend power to change them. The
 * payouts wait until the player ends the phase: then the yield flies to the
 * resources panel and the toxicity to the meter, along a bezier, each mote
 * paying its part as it lands. After the spec's 350 ms pause the mad eat. The
 * player's toxicity slot spins when the phase ends (see `slot-actions.ts`).
 * The bots roll and pick
 * at the same moment. Each bot is paid, and spins its slot, without an
 * animation when its own phase timer fires, whether or not the player has
 * ended the phase yet.
