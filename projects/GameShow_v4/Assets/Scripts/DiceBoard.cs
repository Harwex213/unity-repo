    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

/// <summary>
/// The bonus dice game. Both bays of the acrylic cabinet are played at once, and every die is
/// released together at the top of the cabinet. Three pip dice fall down the wide bay on the
/// left and their faces are added up; two colour dice fall down the narrow bay on the right and
/// the face each one shows is red, green or blue. The roll is the sum and the pair of colours.
///
/// The cabinet in <c>AcrylicGameBoard.fbx</c> carries no colliders, so this component builds
/// them: the four walls of the play cavity, its floor and deck, one capsule per peg and one box
/// per deflector bar. They are rebuilt from scratch every time, so a half-built rig cannot
/// survive. Every dimension is read from the generator that made the model,
/// <c>models/_scripts/17_acrylic_game_board.py</c> — that script stays the source of truth, and
/// the constants here are its numbers in Blender metres.
///
/// The colliders reach right through the cavity, front sheet to back sheet, while the modelled
/// pegs only stand 70 mm proud of the back sheet. That is deliberate: a die must not be able to
/// slip past a peg it looks like it should have hit.
///
/// Each bay passes a die of its own size, and the two sizes are not the same. Take every obstacle
/// of a bay and every chain of them that runs from one wall to the other: the widest gap of the
/// tightest such chain is the widest thing the bay passes. That measures 68.5 mm in the narrow
/// bay, whose three columns of fat pegs are evenly pitched, and 64.0 mm in the wide bay, which is
/// laid out for a far smaller ball. A cube passes a gap at any angle once its long diagonal fits,
/// so the narrow bay takes the 39 mm colour dice, and the wide bay takes the pip dice at 30 mm —
/// the same 39 mm model, placed in the scene at 30/39 of its size, with its mass scaled by the
/// cube of that so the two kinds of die keep one density.
///
/// Fitting the bay is not the same as falling through it cleanly, and the size was picked by
/// soaking 500 rolls per candidate rather than by the diagonal alone. No size from 26 to 36 mm
/// ever left a die stranded, because the nudge always frees one in the end; what the size decides
/// is how often a die has to be nudged at all, and that is what an audience sees. Rolls needing at
/// least one nudge: 56% at 36 mm, 34% at 33 mm, 23% at 32 mm, 23% at 30 mm, 32% at 28 mm, 40% at
/// 26 mm. Smaller is therefore not monotonically better — under 30 mm a die is small enough to
/// enter the narrow channels along the walls, where it then has to be shaken out. 31 mm and 33 mm
/// both sit worse than their neighbours, so the good sizes are a pocket set by the peg pitch, not
/// a threshold. 30 mm and 32 mm tie on that rate; 30 mm was taken for the lower nudges per roll
/// (0.35 against 0.42) and the shorter worst-case roll (6.9 s against 8.4 s). At 36 mm one roll in
/// 200 ran the full 14 s timeout out.
///
/// A peg is a cylinder lying across the cabinet, and a die can land square on the crown of one and
/// balance there. That happened to about one die in eighty. So a roll is only over once every die
/// is on the floor: a die that stops making its way down is nudged loose, and only the timeout can
/// end a roll with a die still in the air.
///
/// This component's own transform is the board's frame — the origin sits at the centre of the
/// plinth on the floor, +Y is up and +Z faces the audience — so the whole rig follows the board
/// if the cabinet is ever moved or turned.
